	<p style="color: indigo;"> When it comes to the internet, what makes people want to interact with a page is its appearance.</p>
	<p style="align-content:center"> One of the most telling features is the alignment of the paragraphs and headers.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Baskerville, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, 'Century Schoolbook L', 'Times New Roman', 'serif'"> <b>Font styles are quick to notice as well. This includes italic and bold lettering to emphasize the tone of an article.</b></p>
	

	<p style="color:indigo;">However the most important aspect that comes to Web Design is the aesthetics ad color choice used inside of a web page. To keep an aesthetic means to keep a certain style/theme that serves as eye candy towards clients who reach the website. It can range from a polished professional look to something colorful and fun for children.</p>
	
	<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue">Picking similar colors</h2>
	
<p style="color:indigo"> When it comes to following an aesthetic, one of the safest ways to do so is to use colors that compliement each other. For example, using two different shades of blue is a good start. </p>
	<p style="color:coral"> However, you can use the <u>color wheel</u> to find its compliementary color which is an orange color like coral. Its important to choose colors that arent considered an eyesore. </p>
